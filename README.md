## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next generation frontend tooling

### What I learned

This was a simple project. The most important thing I learned is it's difficult to match a website to an image. This is why a Figma design is necessary, which points to the importance of a Frontend Mentor Pro subscription. With a design file you can extract the exact colors, spacing values and other variables used throughout the design. This ensures that the website closely matches the design.
